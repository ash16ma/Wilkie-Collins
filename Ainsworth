"A Canterbury Tale Come list to me, and you shall have, without a hem or haw, sirs, A Canterbury pilgrimage  much better than old Chaucer's. 'Tis of a hoax I once played off upon that city clever, The memory of which, I hope, will stick to it for ever.” The Knight of Malta

Prolific author William (usually known as Harrison) Ainsworth, wrote for The London Magazine and had plays and poetry published in numerous journals including The Edinburgh Magazine and The European Magazine. His first success, however, came with the 1834 Gothic romance Rookwood, which invokes Canterbury. 

Rookwood is a historical novel that rewrites infamous highwaymen and criminal figures in Newgate style. Ainsworth was fond of highwaymen stories as a child, so he uses his favourite figure – Dick Turpin – as a character. Turpin meets another infamous criminal active in England around the years following 1730, the so-called ‘knight of Malta’. Styled after John Nichols Thom, also known as Sir William Courtenay, the character regales Turpin with a song of his exploits in Canterbury.

Courtenay was a wine-merchant, and after unsuccessfully standing for parliament in Canterbury was involved with smuggling. He was then tried and committed to the Kent County Lunatic Asylum. Courtenay was largely believed to be insane even before his incarceration in the asylum, his chief delusion that he would be elected into parliament. Ainsworth captures this in the poem as the knight of Malta sings “For surely I the fittest was, and very proper, very,/To represent the wisdom and the wit of Canterbury.” After his release Courtenay gathered a small band of followers and incited what is known as the Battle of Bossenden Wood (1838) by killing a constable. The battle, otherwise known as ‘The Courtenay Uprising’, took place in a village between Canterbury and Faversham and is largely considered to be one the of the last battles fought on English soil.
